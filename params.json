{"name":"PSU Admission Tester","body":"![ScreenShot](http://img196.imageshack.us/img196/6632/20120416154603.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project was to use the information available on Portland State University's [website](http://www.pdx.edu/admissions/minimum-admission-requirements-freshmen) to implement a program that tests whether or not a student would be admitted. Here is a sample of the [information](http://www.pdx.edu/admissions/minimum-admission-requirements-freshmen):\r\n![Sample](http://img836.imageshack.us/img836/4667/20120416155218.jpg)\r\n\r\nWe were also asked to implement a mechanism to report line coverage which is a way to show how many lines of code were used after an operation. Line coverage can be displayed by clicking \"I'm Done!\".\r\n![LC_Sample](http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/7509/20120416162944.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project was created with VB.net. To try it, [download](https://github.com/matarz/PSU_admission_tester/zipball/master) the project and open the file \"[~\\Code\\WP4\\WP4.sln](https://github.com/matarz/PSU_admission_tester/blob/master/Code/WP4/WP4.sln)\" with [Microsoft Visual Studio](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/try) then compile and run the project by clicking Ctrl+F5.\r\n\r\nMost of the code can be found in [~\\Code\\WP4\\WP4\\Form1.vb](https://github.com/matarz/PSU_admission_tester/blob/master/Code/WP4/WP4/Form1.vb).\r\nThe assignment file can also be found [here](http://goo.gl/IyNoS).","tagline":"A program that tests whether or not a student would be admitted to Portland State University","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
